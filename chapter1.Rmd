Chapter 1 start up (R, RStudio, git, GitHub)
=======

**About the project**

*this is about first time use repositories of github, and set up the github page.*

My name is Linping Wang, I used R a bit before, but never use Markdown. I just realize it is amazing in showing result and data analysis process. In addition, it very important work in R project, which help organize and recall the analysis.  

I hope through this course I can build up the good habit about using R, and Git and GitHub. I thank my college Xiandan who introduce this course to me.


1, try the plots 
```{r}
# This is a so-called "R chunk" where you can write R code.

x <- seq(1,10, by = 1)
y <- runif(20, min = 1, max = 100)
plot(diff(y) )
plot(diff (x))

```

2, try R packages and plots

```{r}
library("cobs")
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(globtemp) 
plot(diff(globtemp) )

library("astsa")
plot(cmort)
plot(diff(cmort))

```
